# Tetrite

## How To Play

Tetrite is a game that fuses tetris and tile-matching elements. Use the mouse or arrow keys to move the falling block, and press space to hard drop the block. Upon contact with with other blocks or the ground, the tiles will separate, creating a puzzle and reaction-time based challenge that is not quite like either of its influences.
