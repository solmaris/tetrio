# TETRIO
## How To Play
Apologies for the haphazard guide. A proper tutorial is in the works. 

Tetrio is a tile-matching game disguised as Tetris.
These are the following controls:
- **Left/Right** - Moves the tetromino horizontally
- **Down** - Moves the tetromino down
- **Space** - Hard drops the tetromino
- **Up** - Rotates the tetromino
